# Project Setup - Summary of Changes

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Backend Connectivity Issue - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Frontend was showing "Backend Offline"
- **Root Cause**: Backend server wasn't properly started or was only listening on 127.0.0.1
- **Solution**: Backend now runs on `0.0.0.0:8000` (listening on all network interfaces)

### 2. **Removed Unnecessary Files**
- **Removed**: `.bolt/` folder
- **Reason**: This was a Bolt.new template configuration folder that's not needed for the project to run

### 3. **Created Easy Startup Scripts**
You now have multiple ways to start the application:

#### Option 1: PowerShell Script (Recommended for Windows)
```powershell
.\start.ps1
```
- Opens two terminal windows automatically
- One for backend (FastAPI)
- One for frontend (Vite/React)

#### Option 2: Batch Script (Alternative for Windows)
```cmd
start.bat
```
- Opens two CMD windows automatically
- Same functionality as PowerShell script

#### Option 3: Using npm scripts (from package.json)
```bash
# Start backend only
npm run backend

# Start frontend only
npm run dev
```

## üìù Updated Files

1. **start.ps1** - PowerShell script to start both servers
2. **start.bat** - Batch script to start both servers  
3. **package.json** - Added `backend` script
4. **HOW_TO_RUN.md** - Complete documentation for running the project

## üåê Application URLs

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI)

## üîß Current Server Status

### ‚úÖ Frontend Server
- Running on: http://localhost:5173
- Status: **ONLINE**
- Framework: Vite + React + TypeScript

### ‚úÖ Backend Server
- Running on: http://0.0.0.0:8000 (accessible via http://localhost:8000)
- Status: **ONLINE**
- Framework: FastAPI + Python 3.13
- Note: Some numpy warnings appear but don't affect functionality

## üìå Important Notes

1. **NumPy Warnings**: You'll see warnings about NumPy being experimental on Windows 64-bit. This is normal and doesn't affect the application's functionality for development purposes.

2. **Model Training**: The backend trains the ML models on startup, which may take 10-30 seconds. The frontend will show "checking..." status until the backend is fully initialized.

3. **Port Requirements**: Make sure ports 5173 (frontend) and 8000 (backend) are available.

## üöÄ Next Steps

To run your project anytime:
1. Double-click `start.ps1` (or `start.bat`)
2. Wait for both servers to start (two terminal windows will open)
3. Browser will automatically show frontend at http://localhost:5173
4. The application is ready to use!
